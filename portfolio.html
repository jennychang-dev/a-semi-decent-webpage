    <p><b>Host View</b></p>
    <p>The host view uses vertical paging to allow users to skip to the next video with a simple 'swipe up' gesture. Conversely, with a 'swipe down' gesture, the user is able to go back to the previous video.</p>
    <p>The videos displayed are a compilation of all videos that had been uploaded over the course of building this app.</p>
    <p>Any user of the app can upload videos to the live feed.</p>
    <p>The live feed displays videos in order of most recent to least recent.</p>

  <div class="hostviewtext">
    <p><b>Record View</b></p>
    <p>The user is able to:</p>
    <p>(1) select a video from their video library and/or</p>
    <p>(2) record a video from within the app</p>
    <p>Features include: trimming, adding filters, and selecting a 'cover' for the video.</p>
    <p>Once the user hits the 'upload' button, the videos are sent in URL format to the Firebase database and storage.</p>
    <p>If we then head back to the host view and hit refresh, we can see that a video we just uploaded is now available for all users of the app to see.</p>
